I²C Weight Scale
================

_I²C Weight Scale: strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge amplified in an
instrumentation amplifier, A/D converted and made available over I²C in a PIC
microcontroller._

I²C slave. Reading from the slave responds with a stable digital representation
of the load on the straing gauges under a hacked ordinary weight scale.
